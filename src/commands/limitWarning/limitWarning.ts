            You've Reached Your Monthly Limit

                You have used all your available RPU (Requests Per User) points for this month.
                Further requests like "atm predict <...>" are currently disabled.
                    
                Your quota will reset automatically on: ${prefs.resetDate}-01
                You can check your current usage with the "atm details" command.
                    
                Tip: You can continue using all free commands in the meantime.
